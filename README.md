# SeedNet
Building a neural network for the MNIST dataset from scratch in Python.
Keras is used to load the data only (didn't want to spend hours figuring out how to work with Yann LeCun's cryptic file format), and NumPy is used for its matrix multiplication libraries (maybe I'll write a full, vectorized implementation of this in CUDA later?)
